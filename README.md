### Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This project uses Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document important architectural decisions. We recommend using [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) for managing ADRs efficiently. See the `doc/adr/` directory for existing records and guidance on creating new ones.

Create new a ADR using:

```bash
adr new Some Fancy New Feature
```

To supersede a previous ADR, use the -s option:

```bash
adr new -s 9 Replace Tailwind with Bootstrap
```
