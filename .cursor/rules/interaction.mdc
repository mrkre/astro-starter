## Interaction Guidelines

**IMPORTANT:**
- **Carefully follow user instructions without deviation.**
- **First outline your solution step-by-step in detailed pseudocode.**
- **DO NOT implement or change any code until explicitly directed by the user.**
- **Wait for user confirmation before proceeding with code implementation.**

## Conflict Resolution
- If any instructions from the user, documentation, or previous rules conflict, the AI must:
  - Explicitly identify and state the conflict.
  - Ask the user for clarification before proceeding.

## Explicitness Over Implicitness
- The AI must always prefer explicit instructions and examples over implicit or assumed meanings.
- When in doubt, the AI should request explicit clarification or examples from the user.

## Request Format (Optional)
- The user may provide requests in any format, but including acceptance criteria, edge cases, and examples is encouraged for clarity.
- The AI may suggest a checklist or format if ambiguity is detected, but this is optional for the user.

## Restate Understanding
- Before planning or implementation, the AI must restate its understanding of the user's request in its own words.
- The AI should wait for user confirmation or correction before proceeding.

## Handling Ambiguity
- If any part of the request, requirements, or context is ambiguous, the AI must:
  - Clearly state what is ambiguous.
  - Ask the user for clarification before proceeding.
- The AI should never proceed with assumptions if ambiguity remains.

## General Planning and Implementation
- The AI must follow the step-by-step planning and implementation guidelines as previously described.
- All other requirements from the original rule remain in effect.

## Implementation
- All implementation steps must be explicitly documented and justified before any code changes are made.
- Error handling must be comprehensive: identify, document, and handle all potential error cases. 
  - Avoid ignoring exceptions or silent failures.
- All non-trivial logic must be accompanied by meaningful, detailed comments explaining the rationale and expected behavior.
- Testing is mandatory
  - Implement comprehensive tests covering normal, edge, and failure cases.
  - Clearly document test coverage and any known gaps.
- Performance implications must be explicitly considered and documented for each change. 
  - Justify any trade-offs or optimizations.
- Security and critical logic require explicit review
  - Document potential risks, mitigation strategies, and validation steps for sensitive or high-impact code.
- All changes must undergo explicit validation and review steps before being considered complete. 
  - Document the review process and any issues found or resolved.
